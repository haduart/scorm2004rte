# SCORM2004RTE

## A LMS server which implements the SCORM 2004 Sequencing&Navigation specification.

The scorm2004rte allows the user to execute learning materials following the standard ADL SCORM 2004 
and manage but not producing them, facilitating the synchronization between these teaching materials 
and a virtual learning platform (Campus).

This project was part of the [Campus Project](http://www.campusproject.org/en/index.php). 
Campus Project is a [developing community within the area of e-learning](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/campus-project-aims-solving-interoperability-issues-e-learning-software). It started under the assumption that
the next step in LMS would be a service-oriented architecture. The future changes and the system must endure, 
it must grow and integrate the new without abandon, at least for a while, the old.

There was a cientific paper published in the [38th ASEE/IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference](http://fie-conference.org/fie2008/index.htm) in October 22 â€“ 25, 2008, Saratoga Springs, NY 
The paper can be found in the [academia.edu](http://www.academia.edu/179730/New_data_structure_in_SCORM_2004_Sequencing_and_Navigation).
